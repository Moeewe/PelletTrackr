# Global Footer Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a consistent global footer for Impressum and Datenschutz links that appears on every page, as requested. The footer is always visible at the bottom of the screen, centered, small, and light gray.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Additions (`styles.css`)
- Added `.global-footer` styles with fixed positioning at bottom
- Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur for modern look
- Centered footer links with proper spacing
- Light gray text color (#999) with hover effects
- Mobile-responsive adjustments for smaller screens
- Added `padding-bottom: 50px` to body to prevent content overlap

### 2. HTML Structure Changes

#### Original HTML (`index.html`)
- Removed individual `.footer-links` from each screen/container
- Added global footer before closing `</body>` tag
- Footer contains Impressum and Datenschutz links

#### Modular HTML (`index-modular.html` and `index-modular-complete.html`)
- Added global footer with same structure
- Maintains consistency across all versions

### 3. CSS Features
```css
.global-footer {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    text-align: center;
    z-index: 1000;
}
```

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness
- Optimized padding and font sizes for mobile devices
- Responsive gap between links
- Maintained readability on small screens (down to 320px width)
